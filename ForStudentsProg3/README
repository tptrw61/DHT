CSc 422 Program 3 files for students

Included are:

command.c --- Example driver file.  Currently, the code you are given in dht.c only
              supports END, so everything here is inactive besides the END command

dht.{c,h} -- skeleton code that supports END only

dht-helper.{c,h} -- helper code, e.g., list operations, that you will add

Makefile -- do not modify
